i created my photography instagram account in 2021, with the first actual photography post being posted around late 2023. i have learned a lot since the beginning days on how to shoot
better, due to my participation in photo club in my sophomore through junior years of high school. many of the old posts have now been marked as private, but it is good to look back and see
my growth.
